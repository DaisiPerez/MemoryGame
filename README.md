# Project 4 - Memory Game

Submitted by: Daisi Perez

Memory Game is an app that allows users to play a fun and interactive game where they they match pairs of cards. If the cards have matching emojis, they disapear, if not, then they get flipped over again and the
user must continue finding its missing pair. This game's intended purpose is to challenge the users memory.

Time spent: 3 hours

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] App loads to display a grid of cards initially placed face-down:
  - Upon launching the app, a grid of cards should be visible.
  - Cards are facedown to indicate the start of the game.
- [X] Users can tap cards to toggle their display between the back and the face: 
  - Tapping on a facedown card should flip it to reveal the front.
  - Tapping a second card that is not identical should flip both back down
- [X] When two matching cards are found, they both disappear from view:
  - Implement logic to check if two tapped cards match.
  - If they match, both cards should either disappear.
  - If they don't match, they should return to the facedown position.
- [X] User can reset the game and start a new game via a button:
  - Include a button that allows users to reset the game.
  - This button should shuffle the cards and reset any game-related state.
 
The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User can select number of pairs to play with (at least 2 unique values like 2 and 4).

## Notes

This project was defintely much easier than units 2 and 3. I faced very little issues while creating this app. Id say the only challenge was the UI but even then, it was pretty self explainatory since it was
all done on content view and not storyboard, which I struggled with a lot in the last two units.
